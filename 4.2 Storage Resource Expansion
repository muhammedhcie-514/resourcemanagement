4.2 Storage Resource Expansion
Ceph is used to provide backend storage resources for Cinder.
Step 1 Make preparations.

Create resource pool openeuler and user openeuler in Ceph.
ceph osd pool create openeuler
ceph osd pool application enable openeuler rbd
ceph auth add client.openeuler mon 'allow r' osd 'allow rwx pool=openeuler'
Export the keyring of the openeuler user.
ceph auth get client.openeuler -o ceph.client.openeuler.keyring
Copy the exported keyring file to the /etc/kolla/cinder-volume directory on each storage
node.
Step 2 Register a secret.
Go to the nova_libvirt container on the compute node and run the following command
to generate a random UUID for the secret:
uuidgen

Edit the secret.xml file as follows:
<secret ephemeral='no' private='no'>
 <uuid>8da28902-ab96-458a-94f0-d74d78232434</uuid>
 <usage type='ceph'>
 <name>client.openeuler secret</name>
 </usage>
</secret>
In the file, uuid is the generated UUID, client.openeuler indicates the openeuler
resource pool user.
Define the secret.
virsh secret-define --file secret.xml


Pass the key of the client.openeuler user to the secret. For example, the key in the
following figure is AQAy4yBmCamsLxAAG1hnu7U9nps6d0EiyspE9g==.

Run the following command to pass the key to the secret:
virsh secret-set-value --secret 7e4d77f2-6fb0-45c5-b229-0bb3bd4605c4 --base64
AQAy4yBmCamsLxAAG1hnu7U9nps6d0EiyspE9g==


Check the current secret.
virsh secret-list


After the registration is complete, two files corresponding to the secret are generated in
the /etc/libvirt/secrets directory in the container, as shown in the following figure.
ls /etc/libvirt/secrets/



The /etc/libvirt/secrets directory in the container corresponds to the
/var/lib/docker/volumes/nova_libvirt_secrets/_data directory on the host.
"Name": "nova_libvirst_secrets",
"Source": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/Nova_libvirt_secrets/data",
"Destination": "/etc/libvirt/secrets",


Copy the two generated files to the same directory on compute01, restart the
nova_libvirt container, and check whether the same secret exists in the container.

virth secret-list

After confirming that the secret exists, restart the nova_compute container on each
compute node.



Step 3 Modify the Cinder configuration file.
On each storage node, modify the /etc/kolla/cinder-volume/cinder.conf file as follows
to add configurations for the storage pool to be added:
.....
11 enabled_backends = rbd-1,rbd-2
......
77 [rbd-2]
78 volume_driver = cinder.volume.drivers.rbd.RBDDriver
79 volume_backend_name = rbd-2
80 rbd_pool = openeuler
81 rbd_ceph_conf = /etc/ceph/ceph.conf
82 rados_connect_timeout = 5
83 rbd_user = openeuler
84 rbd_cluster_name = ceph
85 rbd_keyring_conf = /etc/ceph/ceph.client.openeuler.keyring
86 rbd_secret_uuid = 7e4d77f2-6fb0-45c5-b229-0bb3bd4605c4 ### uuid is the secretuuid generated in
the previous step.
87 report_discard_supported = True
......
Restart the cinder-volume container on each storage node. Once the restart is complete,
verify service functionality on the controller node. The following figure shows the
expected output indicating normal service operation.

openstack volume service list


On the dashboard, you can check the available backend storage.

Step 4 Bring online the expanded storage resources.
Create an OpenStack volume type.
openstack volume type create openeuler
In the command, openeuler is a custom name.

Associate the created volume type with the added backend storage.
openstack volume type set openeuler --property volume_backend_name=openeuler
