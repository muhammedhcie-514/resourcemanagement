4.3.1 Creating a Provider Network
In this exercise, you will create a provider network to connect the physical network and
enable floating IP addresses for use in subsequent labs.
Step 1 Check Neutron configurations.
Before creating a network, confirm the provider network name. On the controller node,
enter the neutron_server container and view the content of
/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini.

The file defines a provider network named physnet1 of the flat_networks type.
On the network node, enter the neutron_openvswitch_agent container and view the
content of /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/openvswitch_agent.ini.


The file content suggests that physnet1 corresponds to br-ex. Enter the
openvswitch_vswitchd container and run the ovs-vsctl command to check br-ex
information.

br-ex connects to the physical network through the ens224 NIC of the network node.
Contact the network engineer to check the configuration of the network device interface
connected to ens224. Based on this configuration, you can then choose the type of
shared network to add. If the network type is VLAN or VXLAN, modify the ml2_conf.ini
file in the neutron_server container accordingly. In this exercise, the NICs of all nodes are
connected to a virtual switch without any configuration, so set the network type to flat.

Step 2 Add a network.
Log in to the OpenStack dashboard as an administrator, click Network, and choose
Networks from the expanded menu.


On the displayed page, click Create Network and enter required information.


Click Expand Advanced Options to configure the subnet.

Create a router and add the subnet to the route as an external gateway.



After the operation is complete, the subnet will be used as the provider network to
connect to the physical network.
