4.1 Compute Resource Expansion
4.1.1 Modifying the Kolla Host Inventory
Add information about the node to be added to the host inventory. For example, add
information about compute02 to the required host group.


At the same time, add related information to the hosts file of the deployment node
(controller node in this lab).

In addition, configure password-free login for Ansible.
ssh-copy-id root@compute02

4.1.2 Deploying the Node to Be Added
Preconfigure the node to be added.
kolla-ansible -i multinode bootstrap-servers --limit compute02
Pull the required container image to the node to be added.
kolla-ansible -i multinode pull --limit compute02
Run the docker images command to check the pulled image.


docker images
Deploy the node.
kolla-ansible -i multinode deploy --limit compute02


4.1.3 Verifying the Expansion
Check whether the node to be added is successfully deployed.
openstack hypervisor list


You can also check whether the node is deployed on the Administrator page of Skyline.
